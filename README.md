## Project Proposal

1. The topic I chose for project one is based on the population density of the Hispanic population distribution in Baltimore. 

2. The data I would be using was provided to us in an earlier lab. I would be using the Maryland Census Tracts data, however, at this stage of research, I am having a difficult time locating the progressive change of Hispanic population change from a time frame from 1990-2020. In this span of 30 years, I want to formulate a 5 series of 6 year time frames to see the change in Hispanic population density. I can't find a way to change the data from the Maryland Census Tracts to provide information since that year. As of now, I will try to find a way to acquire that data.

3. I am not sure exactly what transformations or subsets I might need to do now, but given the census tract data, I will have the needed population and area measurements to perform a simple calculation of population density.

4. The only analysis I would be performing is Hispanic population density change from 1990 to 2020 in 6 year time frames

5. I will be creating QGIS maps that will ultimately be transformed into gifs that better represent the change.
